 
In ModelRRMS3D.PNPRO is saved the ESSN exploited to generate the R file called ModelRRMS3D.R . 
Let us denote that the general transitions are 	manually defined into the ODEs system in the R file after its generation.

In 3Dresoluion.R it is implemented the resolution of the ODEs system, in particular the solver is stopped every time an injection (both DAC and EBV) occurs.
